 Students are required to collect two sets of real-world data. Students are 
advised to take extreme precautions when performing tasks in this project due to the current 
COVID-19 pandemic.
(1) Data Set I will be collected from a large number of observations (at least 100) for a 
continuous random variable from a population that is suspected to be normally 
distributed. Examples of such data include the body weight or height of people, dimensions 
of apples (or other fruits), particle size of 3D printing powder, etc.
(2) Data Set II will be the time intervals of a sequence of 100 or more events. For example, 
the time intervals of people getting coffee at a Starbucks location, the time intervals of 
people entering a USPS location, etc.

both Data Set I and II, use software of your choice (e.g., MATLAB, Microsoft Excel, Minitab, 
or manually) to perform the following tasks:
▪ Calculate the sample mean, sample median, sample standard deviation, and sample range;
▪ Calculate the quartiles Q1, Q2, and Q3;
▪ Construct a tabular summary table;
▪ Construct two histograms for Relative Frequency and Cumulative Relative Frequency
