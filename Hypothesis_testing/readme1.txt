Using the Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test with a significance level of 0.05, you are required to 
perform two hypothesis tests. The first one is to test if the collected data set I is sampled from a 
population that follows a normal distribution with a population mean equal to the sample mean 
and a population standard deviation equal to the sample standard deviation. The second one is to 
test the hypothesis that if the collected data set II is sampled from a population that follows 
exponential distribution with a population mean equal to the sample mean. Note that collected data 
set I and II refer to the data you collected from Project Part I.
For each hypothesis test, you should start with structuring the data classes using histograms, and 
merge or split them if necessary to ensure each class has a sufficient number of observations. Then, 
for each data class, calculate the following:
▪ Number of observations in the data set;
▪ Class probability;
▪ Class expected value;
▪ Chi-Square component values.
